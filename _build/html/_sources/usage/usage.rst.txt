Usage
============

Using Chamelon
-----------------

 Basic Chamelon usage is:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ chamelon -c "[compile command]" -e "[error]" input.ml

 This will execute the compile command on input.ml, and produce a minimized output input_min.ml such that the output of the command still contains [error].

Options
++++++++++++++++++++++


Chamelon accepts the following options:

.. program:: chamelon

.. option:: -o [file]

   use ``[file]`` as the output instead of the default - that is, suffixing the input file with ``_min``. Inplace minimization can be achieved by setting the output file to the input file.

.. option:: -t [command]

   use ``[command] input.ml`` to produce a ``.cmt`` file from an OCaml file. This is necessary when the given command is not a compilation command and does not produce ``.cmt`` file by itself. This is also useful if you want to minimize a file when the compilation command produces ``.cmt`` files incompatible with the version of OCaml chamelon is compiled with.

.. option:: -m [minimizers]

  run the minimizers from the comma-separated list of minimizers given as arguments instead of the default iteration order.
